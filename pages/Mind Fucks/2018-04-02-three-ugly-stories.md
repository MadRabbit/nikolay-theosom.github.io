# Three Ugly Stories All Programmers Tell Themselves

Software engineering is hard. We all know that. The sheer amount of knowledge
going in and out of our heads each day is intimidating. The amount of intellectual
strain we put on ourself as a day job is intense. As the result we tend to measure
how good we are at our profession via individual capacity for coping with the
intricacies of the technology.

As the time goes by, i find myself looking at the problem from a different angle
though. Having a set of strong brains for the tech is definitely an important
criteria. But, I tend to think that a person's capacity to manage their mental
state is a way stronger indicator of a success in this field. Which makes it 
a rather cumersome concept to reason about.

I could definitely blame my own circumstances, but, I've trained enough people
in my career to see that pretty much everyone goes through the same stages of
personal and professional development. It's always a pleasure to work with people
who managed to work through their shit, and it's equally disheartening to watch
a lack of good coping skills that work as an impedement to a person's technical
growth.

The good news is that with a bit of effort it can be helped. The way it works
is you can get better by being exposed to the malfunctioning patterns. Once you 
become aware of what's happening, you start to adapt and develop better coping 
mechanisms.

Take for example "ugly stories". Humans looove telling themselves stories about
the external world as a way to keep a consistent picture of the reality in their
heads. The problem is though, it's easier to tell oneself an ugly story than try
to make sense of complicated relationships between events ourside of our direct
control.

The problem is aggravated in situations where an individual has an extended
capacity for reasoning and inventing solutions, like software egnineers do
for example. In those cases the stories can get very complex and subtle. But,
interestingly enough most of them boil down to just a hand full of cathegories.

Today, I'll try my best to expose you to the three most common ones. I'll translate
those into the software engineering realm, but if you're interested in the topic
and want to read the original thoughts behind this article, please read the
"crucial conversations" book. It's pretty dope.

So, without any further adue, here are three ugly stories all software developers
tell themselves now and then, as a way to avoid thinking about the actual problem.

## I'm A Victim

Well, yes, no one goes around and actually tells themselves "oh, i'm a victim of blah".
That would be most ungraceful in our profession. But, now remember last few times
when you struggled to deliver something on time, and then your boss walks in and
asks: "what's the hold up?"

Here are several answers you most definitely heard and given yourself on more than
one occasion:

* Library `blah` gives me crap
* Something doesn't compile
* Tests are flaky
* This code needs refactoring
* CSS/JavaScript

As I said, those responses might look fairly normal, everyone gives those now and
then. But, if you look closer you notice that they always lack the `I` in them. 
They all imply that you poor thing had all the good intentions but you were mistreated
by `A`, `B` and `C`. Essentially it's a way to avoid personal responsibility 
in a situation. It's a grown up version of "my dog ate my homework".

Don't get me wrong here. Issues happen all the time, some of them are more severe
than others. The problem here is that a person is trying to act that problems were
not supposed to be there. In a way they're busy telling the boss that whatever is
happening is not a reflection of their personality or a skill. And, what happens next
is the person will try to distance themselves from the poblem, which is exactly
oppositve from what would be helpful in this situation.

One could often see me telling my engineers "don't be a victim". They hate this,
because it robs them of the easy way out. But, weirdly enough it helps them to
switch into the solution mode rather than lay down and take punches.

## Person A is an A-Hole

Well, yeah, we tend to think of ourselves as good people, who totes don't judge
others. At least we don't call them a-holes. Well, at least until they deserve it.

Now, try to count how many days it was since you heard, or thought one of those?

* Our clients are idiots and don't know how to use a perfectly good app
* Marketing wants me to implement a useless BS feature
* Product manager makes everything a priority
* I asked Nikolay for help and he told me not to be a victim, what jerk!

Those patterns are often coupled with _"I've tried `A`, `B` and `C`, but those a-holes
are being most unreasonable"_.

Surely, there are psychopaths and people who get off by subjigating others. But
your coworkers, even members of a competitor company are hardly on the same
level as Hitler. What's actually happening here is that someone is trying to
doge personal responsibility for resolving a difficult social situation.

Vilianising others to get the higher moral ground is the oldest trick in the book.
It seems natural, but it's not constructive long term. It's a way to force one's
own way by forcing someone else out. What should happen here instead is a
collaborative effort to get in a situation where everyone gets what they want.
And you never get there sustainably by blaming others for being jerks.

## I'm Special

This one is my favorite. I even have a name for it. I call this "Nikolay FM",
because my brain does this shit all the time.

Considering oneself special doesn't seem like a sort of "an ugly story", but in
creative hands it turns into the same responsibility avoidance pattern as the
rest of the ugly stories. Here how it usually goes:

* I could totally solve this problem in 10 mins, but ...
* If only I had time, I would totally improve on ...
* I normally do `A`, `B` and `C`, but in this case ...

In a way one's mind creates a separation between "I" and everything else.
This patterns allows to avoid problem ownership because everything then treated
as a special case where normal rules don't apply anymore. If you win, you
win because "I" was wise to create special circumstances for the win to happen.
And if you loose you loose because it was a special case. Humans can be very 
creative with this pattern.

This tiny voice in your head telling you that you're "not like that". It lies,
because the alternative is hard. Reality is, statistically you're just like
everyone else. You walk the same streets, you hold the same jobs, you cope
with the same emotions. "I'm special" robs you of the opportunity to learn
from others by creating a barrier between you and knowledge.

## Conclusion

Frankly, I'm not very good at conclusions. Probably because people don't appreciate
them as much as they should. But mostly because it's just an archaic tradition
and a waste of time.

See what I did there? ^

Seriously though, if there is one thing I'd like you to walk away with today, it's the
idea that we all are imperfect humans coping with overwhelming circumstances.
Sometimes this resolves in less than graceful stories. But, you can help yourself
and others by identifying those ugly stories, and trying better.

Because owning problems and trying better is all you can really do.
