    <summary type="markdown"><![CDATA[Software engineering is hard. We all know that. The sheer amount of knowledge
going in and out of our heads each day is intimidating. The amount of intellectual
strain we put on ourself as a day job is intense. As the result we tend to measure
how good we are at our profession via individual capacity for coping with the
intricacies of the technology.]]></summary>

reality for most of software engineers, one way or another. Interestingly enough
though, most of us perceive complexity as a purely negative aspect of life;
like an endless uphill struggle. It probably is, but there is another aspect to
it, which I'd like to talk about.]]></summary>
